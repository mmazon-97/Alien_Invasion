In this game the user controls a space ship that will fire rockets at waves of aliens, as the game progresses
the waves will increase in difficulty. Either more ships will spawn or the movement of the aliens will change. 
The ship will be controlled via user input, and if the player manages to shoot all the aliens they will have 
cleared the wave, and will be able to again against a more difficult wave. If the player does not shoot down
all the ships and gets hit by an alien ship the will lose one life. If a player loses three lives, it is 
game over.
